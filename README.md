<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->

## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->

<!-- <img src="readmeAssets\Cover.png"> -->

### Project Description

A mobile game tournament where contestants compete to collect the most dragonballs

### Built With

<!-- angular -->

- [React Native ](https://reactnative.dev/)
<!-- Angular Material -->
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
<!-- other -->
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps) installed on your machine.

**The `Backend` for the app**
The project utilized [Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com/) services for backend functionality:

- `Firestore Database` was utilized for storing data.
- `Firebase Authentication` was used to handle authentication related service, like logging in and registering users.

### Installation

1. Download the APK (Android) or IPA (iOS).
2. Install package.

### How to Play

1. Create an account to access competitions and profile or Log in.

<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->

### Database Architecture

<!-- <img src="readmeAssets\database Architecture.png"> -->

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Backend Functionality

<br>

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

- Made use of both `functionality` to implement a specific feature.
- `MVC/MVVM` design architecture implemented.
- `Plugin` for this.
- ETC.

#### Highlights

- Synchronous communication

#### Challenges

- Intergrating Mapbox into the Expo workflow with EAS

<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

- Feedback one.
- Feedback two.

#### Unit Tests

`Unit Tests` were conducted to establish working functionality. Here are all the tests that were ran:

> [!Note]
> Post man and insomnia where both used to test all backend CRUD functionality.

**Test 1** of Create User functionality :

- We tested the back of the user create function using Postman to test the CRUD

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- Refining (a process).

## Final Outcome

<!-- MOCKUPS -->

### Mockups
